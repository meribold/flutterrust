# flutterrust

Just a university assignment.

## Building

You need GNU Make, GCC (`g++`), Boost, ICU, and wxWidgets.

For a release build, run

    make

and for a debugging build

    make DEBUG=1

All targets are created in subdirectories of `build`.  The main executable is called
`flutterrust`.
